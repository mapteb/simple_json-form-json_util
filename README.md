# simple_json-form-json_util

When transacting with cloud APIs developers often need a way to map json to a form and back to json

This project provides a simple jQuery utility to map json to form and then back to json. The utility includes three reusable js files - buildForm.js, initFormValues.js and submitForm.js.

buildForm.js
The js function in buildForm.js generates the select, checkbox and radio option tags from a given json

initFormValues.js
The js function in initFormValues.js sets initial values for the form elements from a given json

submitForm.js
The js function in submitForm.js captures user entered form values as json

A demo for the usage of these files is included as demo.html
